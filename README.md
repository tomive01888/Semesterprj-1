### Description

Client:
- Community Science Museum
- Target range: 
    - Children age 7-15
    - Families
    - School trips

Brief:
Design and build a modern, accessible and responsive web presence for the client using the provided image and text content.

The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; while aiming at a younger audience it should not patronise them with overtly childish themes. The core purpose of the site is to excite and entice people to visit the museum.

The client has not supplied a logo because the museum committee cannot decide on a final design. You are free to create a placeholder logo for the client.

My job:
To ensure the client gets a good layout and responsive website. Follow the instructed guidelines for my task and deliver a final product my client approves.
