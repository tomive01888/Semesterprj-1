## Description
Client:
- Community Science Museum
- Target range: 
    - Children age 7-15
    - Families
    - School trips

### Brief:
Design and build a modern, accessible and responsive web presence for the client using the provided image and text content.
The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; while aiming at a younger audience it should not patronise them with overtly childish themes. The core purpose of the site is to excite and entice people to visit the museum.
The client has not supplied a logo because the museum committee cannot decide on a final design. You are free to create a placeholder logo for the client.

### My job:
To ensure the "client" gets a good layout and responsive website. Follow the instructed guidelines for my task and deliver a final product my "client" approves. With the use of no javascript only HTML and CSS, keeping it to vanilla code. Utilizing checkbox hack to have dropdown menus, hamburger functionalities and more.
This school project was for us to take a step into reality or what a task could be with limitations and user stories we had to follow and master a schedule using Kanban board and Figma design. Both were we in charge of, planning the weeks and follow our own work plan. Designing according the assignment target audience and keep as well a balanced overall design and responsiveness with accessibilities included, using WAVE and W3C markup validations.
